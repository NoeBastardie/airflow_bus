# airflow_gcp_dbt_flask_project
Project made by Noe Bastardie in december 2022.

This readme describe the general approach and all the steps of the project --> This repo only contains the code of the step 1 (Airflow) !


# Goal :
- Create a basic flask app that displays a folium map which contains real time position of bus (bus that are impacted by an incident on their route will be directly identifiable).

# Approach :


(1) Extract bus datas (JSON) and import them into BigQuery using Airflow 

(2) Create a new BQ table with all the informations needed using DBT

(3) Create the app using Flask and Folium.


# Data lifecycle :


Washington bus data (JSON) --> Airflow dag (step 1) --> Cloud Storage --> Airflow dag (step 2) --> BigQuery --> DBT --> BigQuery --> Flask app

# Data sources :
- Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority API : https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/ :
